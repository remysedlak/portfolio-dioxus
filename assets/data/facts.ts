    text: `I'm Remy Sedlakâ€”a <b>builder</b>, <b>problem-solver</b>, and <b>explorer</b> at heart. I'm passionate about <b>empowering creativity through code</b>, whether that's crafting <b>intuitive user experiences</b>, building <b>robust backend systems</b>, or experimenting with <b>new tools and workflows</b>. I love taking on <b>new challenges</b> and <b>learning from every project</b> I tackle.

My journey in tech has been shaped by a drive to <b>make things better</b>, whether that's <b>optimizing</b> a process, designing a <b>clean interface</b>, or <b>collaborating with others</b> to bring ideas to life.`,

    title: "Curious by Nature",
    text: `At my core, I'm <b>fascinated by how things work</b>: how <b>systems connect</b>, <b>scale</b>, and <b>improve</b>. That curiosity has guided me toward using <b>type-safe languages</b> and <b>interface-driven design</b>, helping me manage <b>complexity</b> and stay in <b>control</b> as my projects grow.

Through my coursework in <b>Java</b> and <b>C</b>, I've gained a deep appreciation for how systems operate at a <b>low level</b>, and I've become especially interested in <b>Unix systems</b>. I enjoy <b>diving into the details</b>, understanding the "<b>why</b>" behind the "<b>how</b>," and applying that knowledge to <b>build better software</b>.`,

    text: `Beyond tech, I enjoy <b>writing music</b>, <b>lifting weights</b>, and <b>exploring the outdoors</b>. I believe that <b>balance</b> and <b>curiosity outside of work</b> help fuel <b>creativity</b> and <b>resilience</b> in my projects. I often like to pick up a <b>new book</b> on a part of tech I haven't explored yet, or just to <b>learn something new</b>.

Whether I'm <b>learning something new</b>, <b>collaborating with others</b>, or just enjoying a <b>quiet moment</b> with my cat, <b>Church</b>, I'm always looking for ways to <b>grow</b> and make a <b>positive impact</b>.`,
